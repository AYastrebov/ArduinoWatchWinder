This Arduino controlled watch winder was developed because commercially available
winders did not offer the control I wanted at a price point I was 
comfortable with. I am not a programmer, so please forgive any non-conventional
decisions and/or formatting.

This project makes use of the MENWIZ library for creating the LCD menu structure.

***NOTE: The newest version of this project uses an altered version of the MENWIZ library,
which I have titled MENWIZ_LiquidTWI2. A zip file of this altered library is provided.

There are four navigational buttons (down, up, confirm, escape) which are used to 
navigate the menu and change settings.

This project provides ability for the following:

  Adjustable Turns Per Day (TPD)
    -increments of 5 (an arbitrary decision)
  
  Adjustable Direction
    -clockwise
    -counterclockwise
    -both
  
  Adjustable Turn Frequency
    -turn the watch every n number of minutes. Do you want that hour's turns to
     happen all at once at the top of the hour, or spread out to occur every 5 minutes
     throughout the hour? etc...
    -winder automatically calculates number of turns per cycle, depending on
     cycle frequency and TPD (precise to 1/6400th of a turn)
  
  Full Wind
    -run continuously, to wind a watch from a dead stop. 800 turns (arbitrary
     decision)
  
  Turn Counter
    -displays number of turns since midnight
      -does not include turns from "full wind" action
  
  GPS Receiver
    -get GPS time for on-screen clock
      -also used for resetting turn counter at midnight
