I developed this Arduino controlled watch winder because the commercially available
winder did not offer as much control as I was looking for at a price point I was 
comfortable with. I am not a programmer, so please forgive any non-conventional
decisions and/or formatting.

This project makes use of the MENWIZ library for creating the LCD menu structure.

There are four navigational buttons (down, up, confirm, escape) which are used to 
navigate the menu and change settings.

This project provides ability for the following:

-Adjustable number of turns per day (TPD)
  -increments of 5, an arbitrary decision.
-Adjustable direction
  -clockwise
  -counterclockwise
  -both
-Adjustable turn frequency
  -turn the watch ever n number of minutes. Do you want that hour's turns to happen 
   all at once at the top of the hour, or spread out every 5 minutes throughout the hour?
  -winder automatically calculates number of turns per cycle, depending on cycle frequency
-Full wind
  -run continuously, to wind a watch from a dead stop. 800 turns (arbitrary decision).
-Turn counter
  -displays number of turns since midnight.
-GPS receiver
  -get time for on screen clock, and for resetting turn counter at midnight.
